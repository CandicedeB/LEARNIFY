In South Africa, where unemployment is high, a free education platform can aim to address this challenge by focusing on goals such as providing employability skills, increasing access to education, fostering empowerment and economic growth, and promoting community development. The target audience would include unemployed youth, underprivileged communities, adult learners, and micro-entrepreneurs/small business owners. By tailoring programs and resources to the specific needs of these groups, the platform can play a crucial role in addressing unemployment, empowering individuals, and driving inclusive economic development.
