# LEARNIFY

## Introduction

In South Africa, where unemployment is high, a free education platform can aim to address this challenge by focusing on goals such as providing employability skills, increasing access to education, fostering empowerment and economic growth, and promoting community development.  

**Purpose of LEARNIFY:**

- Tailoring programs and resources to the specific needs of these groups, the platform can play a crucial role in addressing unemployment, empowering individuals, and driving inclusive economic development.
- Making learning more accesible to  people everywhere that don't necessarily have the financial means to attend a higher learning institution.
- The target audience would include unemployed youth, underprivileged communities, adult learners, and micro-entrepreneurs/small business owners.
